# workout_tracker

A workout tracking app with a long list of features that need to be implemented.

## TODO:

### Basic Functionality:

- [ ] Saving workout templates
- [ ] Once templates are implemented, launch workouts from templates with exercises and sets pre-added rather than needing the user to add them all
- [ ] Showcase previous weight x reps for each relevant set inside the overlay to give users an idea of how to progress
- [ ] Implement settings page to choose units of measure, and many more down the line (default to lbs since I'm in NA)
- [ ] Implement some basic analytics features, charts showcasing various metrics for different exercises
- [ ] Implement edit functionality for history of workouts
- [ ] Add many many more exercises to the exercise list
- [ ] Add fuzzy finding search to the exercise list for fun
- [ ] Add calendar view for history page to quickly navigate to different workouts in the past, if multiple on the same day it should filter by the chosen date or scroll the list to that date
- [ ] Rework history tab from including the date on each individual workout to having the workouts grouped by date
- Implement different themes, such as dark mode and oled dark mode
- [ ] Add ways to sort exercises / filter by tag, ie sorting by recently performed, alphabetical, filtering by body part or isolation vs compound lift etc.
- [ ] In exercises details

### Stretch Goals:

- [ ] Body Scan from video of a person spinning in place, as far as I can tell it is technically possible but could be very complex to implement single camera photogrammetry
- [ ] Implement ability to import csvs for a workout history from other apps as a migration
